# Machine_Learning_Coursera
This repo to save the practice code for following Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera.\
Some parts are already coded in 2017, but I push all together this time in 2019.\
The editted code and comments are on my own styles for conveniences.\
Please refer to someone else's Repos to get more formatted learning materials.
